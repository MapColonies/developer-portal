### Pagination

Some of our services return multiple results per request, according to filter parameters, and due to geographic entities the returned payload may be very large. In order to solve this issue we implement `pagination` using special parameters.

We recommend using `pagination` in order to control the amount of results returned and easily split our request in to multiple requests. Read more in the documentation page for each service.
